        Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.

        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.

    <p>
      The visualization below illustrates the increase in walls built around the world since
      the end of WWII. The data was collected by Elisabeth Vallet, Zoe Barry and Josselyn Guillarmou,
      who define "walls" in the broadest sense "as a political divider that comprises complex technologies,
      control methods, legislative provisions and "securing the border" discourse."
